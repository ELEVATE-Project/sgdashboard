    <h2>Shikshagraha Network</h2>
    <p>Shikshagraha is about people - partners, communities, leaders, coming together to make our schools better. Across states, momentum partners drive on-ground action while strategic partners offer policy support, tools, and resources. Dialogues like Shiksha Samvaad help connect these efforts, creating spaces for shared learning and collective problem-solving.</p>
